What does “open source” mean?

When a project is open source, that means anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.

Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration, allowing people to spread and improve projects quickly. Also because it gives users a potential to control their own computing, relative to closed source. For example, a business using open source software has the option to hire someone to make custom improvements to the software, rather than relying exclusively on a closed source vendor’s product decisions.

Free software refers to the same set of projects as open source. Sometimes you’ll also see these terms combined as “free and open source software” (FOSS) or “free, libre, and open source software” (FLOSS). Free and libre refer to freedom, not price.
